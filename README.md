Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning
Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handled missing values using mean strategy
Addressed inconsistent or erroneous data entries.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated descriptive statistics.
Created visualizations: histograms, bar charts, box plots, correlation matrices.
3. Outlier Detection and Removal
Detected outliers using  IQR, visualization techniques and handled outlier 
4. Manual Data Splitting
Split the cleaned dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
5. Model Training
Trained a KNN model on the training set using manual splitting.
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the KNN model using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
Results are compared of manual splited data and of cross validation.
Created visualizations: confusion matrices, ROC curves to illustrate model performance.
